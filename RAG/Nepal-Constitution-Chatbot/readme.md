# 🇳🇵 Nepal Constitution Chatbot

A simple yet powerful chatbot to answer questions related to the **Constitution of Nepal**. Built using:

- 📚 LangChain
- 🦙 LLaMA 3 via Groq API
- 💾 FAISS for vector search
- 📄 PDF text extraction (PyMuPDF)
- 🧠 HuggingFace Embeddings
- 🌐 Streamlit for UI

---

## ✨ Features

- Ask natural questions related to the Constitution of Nepal.
- Fast and intelligent answers powered by LLaMA-3-70B via Groq.
- Local document processing with vector similarity search using FAISS.
- Fully interactive Streamlit chat interface.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (RAG Pipeline)

This chatbot uses the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** technique.

### What is RAG?

> **RAG** = *Retrieval* of relevant document chunks → *Augmented* into prompt → *Generated* answer from LLM.

Instead of relying only on the model's memory, we fetch real document context and inject it into the model’s input. This results in far more accurate, grounded answers.

---

## 🚀 Pipeline Steps

### 1. Text Extraction
We use `PyMuPDF` to extract the entire text from `Constitution-of-Nepal.pdf`.

### 2. Chunking & Embeddings
The text is split into overlapping chunks using LangChain’s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, then embedded using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`.

### 3. Vector Store (FAISS)
The embedded chunks are stored in a local FAISS index to support fast similarity-based retrieval.

### 4. LLM via Groq API
For answering, we use **LLaMA 3-70B (8192 context)** via `langchain_groq.ChatGroq`.

### 5. Streamlit Chat UI
The interface is built using Streamlit’s `st.chat_message` with persistent chat history.
